When Funtime Freddy drops off Bon Bon near the vents, the puppet looks at what he has to climb up. Bon Bon attempts just grabbing on to the wall, but he falls and hits the floor. He then tries just clawing at the wall, hoping he would manage to find a place to latch on to, but this fails. A table is nearby, so Bon Bon attempts to climb the leg and then jump to the vent, but forgets that he has no legs and falls on his back to the ground. After a while, he manages to get himself upright and once again attempts to climb the table, and once getting that done scoots over to the wall and tries climbing, but falls once again, topples over the side of the table, and then ends up falling into a janitor's bucket and almost short-circuits. Once finally getting out, Funtime Foxy walks by, sees Bon Bon, and then walks away. Angered, Bon Bon takes another half hour to try and get to Funtime Foxy but gives up and scoots away. This time, he can't even climb the table leg anymore due to him being so slippery from the water. He immediately topples over on, once again, on his back. Thankfully, Bidybab comes by and finally rescues the suffering puppet. Bidybab's solution is to throw Bon Bon to the vent like a football. The throw misses and Bon Bon hits his head on the wall and makes a crack, but grabs the ledge of the vent at the last second. After a while, he gets up and finally crawls his way to victory. He ends up falling on the desk, gets caught on a cable and pulls down a desktop fan down with him to smash him. Bon Bon is suprised when he realizes there is no nightguard. The camera was still there, so he took a look at that. He was shocked to realize that there were no more animatronics in the building, and even worse, it was 9:28.

1,But winning 4 in a row after being 0-3 in a bo7.,Eoxeration,leagueoflegends,1,1,0,2014-09,2014-09-01 02:20:07,"It's not about the results or the math, it's about the intensity of such a format and the feeling that the end victory is deserved. In my opinion, a Bo5 suits a League competitive match more than a Bo3 or Bo7. A typical League game generally lasts between 25 and 50 minutes. If we include champion selects and breaks between games, a Bo7 could last up to 8-10 hours. I don't think anyone (casters, players, audience) would have the endurance or the patience for this. A Bo3 is short and sweet, which isn't a bad thing. However, the intensity isn't really there. If it's 2-0, the victory doesn't feel very satisfactory. Typical reaction goes: ""That's it? Well, that was disappointing."" If it goes 1-1, having a single game decide which team wins feels out of place. The losers will inevitably still feel like they could've won the series with a bit more luck, and the winners will never get the confirmation that they were the better team, since they could've easily lost the next one as they lost the other one. This is what a lot of fans felt in many series last year (remember the multiple C9 vs Fnatic matchups? They all lead to controversial results). You also don't get comebacks in a bo3. A Bo5 lasts 3 to 5 hours, which feels adapted for League. A 5 game series is a reasonable test of endurance - any longer would be inappropriate as either team would be significantly weaker than normal due to fatigue. Nonetheless, the main strength of the Bo5 format is that it feels definitive. A 3-0 or 3-1 result is a stomp and nobody can contest that the winner was the better team or deserved the victory. A 3-2 is more controversial, but unlike a 2-1 result, it feels complete because you kinda just accept that both teams are fairly even, and each had 5 chances to prove their worth. The loser gets the recognition that they went toe to toe with the winners, but they don't get the excuse that they got cheesed out of a victory. It's not based on any math or logic, it's just a psychological thing. Also, coming back from a 0-2 score makes a great story - winning 2 in a row from 0-1, not so much.","It's not about the results or the math, it's about the intensity of such a format and the feeling that the end victory is deserved.

My grandfather was the comptroller general of Detroit at the time, so the bonds were issued and he went to New York to sell them on the bond market. At the last minute, he was stopped by a legal challenge, that said the printing on the official announcement of the bond issuance was too small. He of course was like, wtf?, printing too small? The bonds had already issued so had to be sold immediately or they would be come ""stale"" (and un-sellable) so the case was fast tracked to the MI supreme court, which sure enough held that the printing was too small. The bond sale was cancelled and the stadium was never built. My grandfather immediately tried to figure what happened and eventually go to the bottom of it. The MI supreme court had a majority of democrats and it was this majority that killed the bond sale. And everyone knows the democratic party is the party of unions, which at this time where still very powerful in Michigan. Apparently, the unions of Detroit were afraid this stadium would be a financial failure, leaving the city with a bunch of debt. The city would then have to raise taxes to pay it off, and the unions didn't want to pay more taxes. So they found a technicality and killed the deal. The lesson here being if you don't like taxes and don't want the government wasting your money, then unions are your friend, not your enemy.

I am a woman in my late 20s and in a graduate program in the bay area. I've been a Hillary supporter since the 2008 primaries (though I love Obama and what he has done for the country). I really appreciate the hard work she has done during her career to stand up for underrepresented people. As someone who grew up in DC I also find it important that she is good at coalition building because I feel like in our system that is the main way to get substantial policy passed in a country that is pretty politically divided. The problem is maybe one of culture shock, but here in CA it felt like it was a crime on my campus to support Hillary instead of Bernie in the primaries. Everything was Bernie or Bust. Now during the general election most of my peers thankfully seem to still want to vote democrat, but it is impossible to talk about Clinton with them without someone (or multiple people) declaring their mistrust, saying they are voting for the lesser of two evils, or saying ""I'm not enthusiastic about her but I don't want Trump."" I guess it saddens me that so many of my progressive peers seem to really dislike Clinton and I really don't understand why that is the case. She has voted pretty constantly liberal and is from sooo many accounts an earnest, intelligent, and extremely hardworking person. I feel like people undermine her talent for listening to all voices because they want boxes on their agenda checked without realizing that change in lawmaking takes hard work and cooperation. I want to figure out a way to make my generation enthusiastic about Clinton, but it seems like years of GOP propaganda against her (and then Bernie's takedown of her in the primaries using many of those same cliches) has made it hard to get young people on board. Does anyone here have strategies for getting people enthusiastic about this talented candidate? Coping mechanisms? It just really upsets me that people hate her so much, when she has been doing great work for most of her career.

Here's a bit of info I do have: * His name is ""Greg Ream"". * My girlfriend's mothers name is Gwendolyn (goes by Wendy). * She would've been conceived around August 1987. * Her mother worked at a Steak N Shake at the time, and thinks he did too. * The state is Florida. We do not know the city, but best guess is either Pinellas Park or Hudson/New Port Richey area. Any help would be appreciated![SEP]Nothing better than a crusading boyfriend.",false_negative

1,Inb4 Amu Yunos dies; game loops back to the very start (including level/gem reset),EmpressLinx,bravefrontier,2,2,0,2016-08,2016-08-26 07:11:22,"Amu Yunos Theory Hello, you might know me as the lore crack around here, with my last one being a massive post of Lucius and his deep twisting plans that linked major of the units' fate in Grand Gaia and a small one on Fizz. This time, I'm doing Amu Yunos purely because something clicked in me. Here's the known facts we have of her so far. 1. She is the oldest demon 2. She is ruler of Zamburg known for a huge ass giant demon sewed to a mountain. 3. She's always expressing boredom. 4. She challenged you to fight her because she was bored, not because she dislike you or humans, or even to seek conquest of Grand Gaia. 5. She controls Time and Space. Example being her skill names in Raid, her dialogues in Quest, Horia's lore, and Noel's theory expressed in Mirfah GQ. Now here's the great part. Courtesy to popular belief that she's dead, I believe the opposite for few reasons. Considering the facts above... We can conclude she's immortal, far more so compared to Karna Masta. Why? She has lived for countless years, so at one point she must had interests of activities she pinned on herself, yet now she's bored beyond belief that can be tracked to even before the sewing of the demon giant to a mountain. So it can be safely guessed that she showed interest in ruling Zamburg and perhaps more because things changes throughout centuries, perhaps she ruled more than just Zamburg. Considering fact number 5... It would be because of this that she's bored of everything now. She has been everywhere and nowhere with her ability to travel time and space, seeing everything and nothing. Perhaps it could be said she even knows about Mirfah's GQ Gold ending with her own power but chose to not go down that path. Why? First, let's hold off her reason and expand into Horia lore. We know that Amu Yunos rescued Horia from the state of death, in fact some people concluded that Horia is a technical zombie because unlike her OE art, she's shown to be blue skinned which is present when your body enter rigor mortis after sufficent time or low enough temperature, and we know Ishgria is pretty cold place save for some rare places where it's extremely hot. Seria even complained about the cold some time throughout Quest so we can conclude that it is the low temperature that caused Horia to become blue permanently after death. Moving on from Horia's blue skin, why did Amu Yunos revive her, we didn't have much of reasons considering her persona, but we can say it's because she was bored and wanted to change something for fun. But how does doing something fun links to Amu Yunos? The only thing Horia did AFTER being revived by Amu Yunos was creating and birthing Rize, given the alias of God of Destruction, not to be confused with Karna Masta. So the alias alone would be placed into question considering centuries later, Karna Masta would ruin Ishgria in his rampage. This is connected to Karna Masta somehow in regards to Amu Yunos's plan... Linking this with all of the things she've said and more... It's pretty safe to say Amu Yunos is definitely planning something and is using boredom to cover it up. Considering the above, Amu Yunos has multiple ""route"" to select for her own plan, but ""our"" is selected, our world as it is currently. Now factoring in what we know from Amu Yunos's action in Ishgria when ""we"" are involved. 1. She found us. 2. She challenged us instead of standing down. 3. Blew up a volcano to show she's serious. 4. Confronted us for real at her home and defeated rather simply. 5. Told us we'd meet again, foreshadowing future events that happened. 6. Meets again at the cave where Mirfah asked us to fight him to test his strength, where Kalon would confronts us to protect her. 7. Ends up indirectly meeting her via Mora. Afterward is completely unknown of her, which is why it's presumed she's dead. I thinks otherwise as I've stated earlier. Now, speculation begins. Amu Yunos is 100% planning something. 1. Due to her confronting us, Mora was able to absorb her power. 2. All Mora needed was Shusui and Barion's power to open the gate to Menon. 3. Due to Amu Yunos's 'stalling' Barion is undergoing ritual to transfer Karna Masta to Grand Gaia resulting in Barion being at half power at confrontation. 4. Thank to her apparent odd actions, we were able to enter Menon, defeat the Holy Emperor's Body after much efforts. 5. And again with Holy Emperor's Soul with Ark and Ilias's assistance in Mildran. So why would she die for Karna Masta's complete defeat? She wouldn't, and **can't.** My speculation shows me that Amu Yunos is full blown **IMMORTAL** as in she can't die, period. Why can't she die? My estimate tells me that Amu Yunos is similar to Kalon in regard of body spliting, with a small expectation. Unlike Kalon whose split bodies on one plane, Amu Yunos splits her on multiple planes of existence and throughout histories. This would explains why she's the oldest demon, and told us she'd meet us again someday. And again unlike Kalon, Amu Yunos can't control this aspect of existing, as in she can't choose to die because she want to, as copies of her bodies would always exist elsewhen. By now, you should be getting to what I'm saying. Her plan is that she wants to completely die. With her power, she've seen all possible routes, all possible outcomes, and all possibilities, and yet couldn't die in any of them. She'd pinned her one last hope... ""**US**"" The Summoner. She figured as long as she continue to indirectly guide us toward an unseen route she can't experience, because she's dead in there, she would die. She fed us possibilities of growth through the most brutal and difficult challenges present to us, the Holy Emperor Karna Masta. If we could defeat him, we can defeat Amu Yunos. But why would Karna Masta be relevant to her? Simple, Amu Yunos most likely holds some similar familiarity with Karna Masta in combat strength. She never did take us seriously after all the two times we fought Amu Yunos, hell even her power used by Mora didn't do anything much when you look through her data. My theory is... Amu Yunos ends up being the **FINAL** boss comparable to Karna Masta in his full power (We only defeated parts of Karna Masta) and more just so we can fulfill her desire to die, but parts of her refuse to let her die so easily, so we'd have to fight her hard and serious to grant her peace. ~~**In fact I'm totally making a whole new battle system just for Amu Yunos where it would be very difficult to not pay attention**~~ What do you guys think?
